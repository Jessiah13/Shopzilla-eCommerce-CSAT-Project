# Shopzilla-eCommerce-CSAT-Project
Completing a Lean Six Sigma Process Improvement Project about Shopzilla's customer satisfaction.
***


## Project Scenario & Requirements:

Shopzilla leadership believes that improving customer satisfaction will lead to more repeat buyers, directly impacting long-term growth. Recently however, they noticed a drop in their CSAT performance in the month of August, falling below their usual targert of 85% and need data driven insights to identify the key friction points in the customer journey and recommend the right strategies for improvement.

They’ve brought in a Data Analyst (You) to investigate the factors affecting CSAT, uncover actionable insights, and build a dashboard to track improvement efforts over time.

-----

### Tasks:
- Review and understand the data. (Clean and Standardize if necessary)
- Investigate the root cause of low CSAT across different channels and product categories.
- Pinpoint pain points in the customer journey if there’s any to reveal (e.g., products defects, shipping delays, slow response).
- Understand the impact of customer service on overall satisfaction and identify gaps in support processes.
- Deliver a clear analysis of customer metrics.
- Provide actionable recommendation for improving key areas.
- Suggest short term and long-term strategies to improve satisfaction, focusing on the most pressing concerns.
- Develop a dashboard to track the progress of CSAT improvement and the effectiveness of recommended solutions.
