# Shopzilla-eCommerce-CSAT-Project
Completing a Lean Six Sigma Process Improvement Project about Shopzilla's customer satisfaction.
***


## Project Scenario & Requirements:

Shopzilla leadership believes that improving customer satisfaction will lead to more repeat buyers, directly impacting long-term growth. Recently however, they noticed a drop in their CSAT performance in the month of August, falling below their usual targert of 85% and need data driven insights to identify the key friction points in the customer journey and recommend the right strategies for improvement.

Theyâ€™ve brought in a Data Analyst (You) to investigate the factors affecting CSAT, uncover actionable insights, and build a dashboard to track improvement efforts over time.
